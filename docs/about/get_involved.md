# Get involved

A great way to get involved is to contribute to the project.

## Ways to contribute

### Development
By becoming a developer, you can make a big difference while enjoying a
challenging and fun experience. You'll learn to be a better coder, you will
get to implement new features, defeat daunting bugs and create stunning
products, all the while collaborating with people from all around the world.

### Translation
Are you fluent in multiple languages? By contributing your translations,
you can make it more pleasant for you to use, and open it up to millions
 of potential new users.

### Documentation
Even with the best-designed software, users will need documentation to
help them do what they want and get the most out of it.

### Bug Triaging
By keeping track of incoming bug reports, verifying them, improving them
and cleaning them up, you will help developers figure out what bugs they
need to work on and help them get the information they need to fix them.
You don't need any coding knowledge to participate, but experience has shown
that members of this team often learn a lot in the course of dealing with
bug reports, and many move on to developing the software itself.
