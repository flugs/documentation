## Get in touch

#### Found a issue? Want a new feature?

Open an issue or get involved ad raise a pull request on GitHub.

#### E-Mail
There is an active mailing list for Flugs users and developers. Here all
important discussion around future development of Flugs takes place. If you
want to start contributing, you should definitely join our mailing list.

The mailing lists are open, you do not need to be subscribed to contact us.
Do not forget to ask to be CCâ€™d in answers in that case.

#### IRC Chat
Visit our IRC channel #flugs at Freenode (join via web chat here). You can
often meet Flugs developers there, and we are usually willing to help with
user support requests as well as development questions.

If you're unfamiliar with IRC please read on general IRC guide lines
(netiquette) here. In particular note: People may not have an answer to your
question right away, so please be patient. In IRC terms, this might mean
five minutes, but could also be 2-3 hours or more.

### Stack Overflow

Use the _flugs_ tag to search for questions and answers on Stack Overflow.

## Commercial Support

For commercial support (for companies or individuals requesting specific
bug fixes or custom feature development), training requests, press inquiries
or specific questions for the Flugs maintainers, but not for general support
questions: Please email us!
